# GoogleAnalyticsModule
.Net HttpModule for Google Analytics

A need arose recently to implement Google Analytics into an OLD ASP website. Instead of adding the code snippet into thousands of static HTML files, using the HttpModule within IIS just made sense.

The code should be fairly straight forward to follow, feel free to add/remove/use at your own discretion.
